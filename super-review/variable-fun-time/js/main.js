//--- Easy
//create a variable and assign it a number
let x = 123
//minus 10 from that number
result = x - 10
//print that number to the console
console.log(result)
//--- Medium
//create a variable that holds a value from the input
let num = document.querySelector('#danceDanceRevolution').value
//add 25 to that number
let addNumToNum = num + 25
//alert that number
alert(addNumToNum)
//--- Hard
//create a variable that holds the h1

//add an event listener to that element that console logs the sum of the two previous variables

    <h2>What is a variable?</h2>
    <p>A variable is "Named Storage" for data.</p>
    <p>It can be used to store data and be given any name that we give it. Variables allow you to setup your code.</p>
    <p>A variable name should have a clean, obvious meaning, describing the data that it stores.</p>
    <h2>What is an example of a variable?</h2>
    <p>let message = 'Hello I am that data being stored in a variable. I am also called a string, because I am random text.'</p>
    <p>("message" is the name of the variable)</p>
    <p>alert(message); (The message text will now appear whenever you run this in the browser)</p>
    <h2>What are the 3 ways you can declare a variable?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>var (This is the old way of declaring, its not used much anymore)</li>
        <li>const (Semi short for constant. Use this if your variables will always be the same</li>
        <li>let (Use this instead of var. It was introduced to make it easier to see where variables live in our code)</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tasks:</h2>
    <h3>Task One:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Declare two variables: admin and name.</li>
        <li>Assign the value "John" to name.</li>
        <li>Copy the value from name to admin</li>
        <li>Show the value of admin using alert (must output “John”).</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Task Two:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?</li>
        <li>Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. How would you name that variable?</li>
    </ol>

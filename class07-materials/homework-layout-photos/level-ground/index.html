			<h1>WHERE GRIT MEETS OPPORTUNITY</h1>
			<p>At Leve Ground (LG), urban youth cultivate grit and resilience through Mixed Martial Arts. They learn to apply these values 'off the mat' in the pursuit of their ambitions through our Student Trainer Certification and College Access programs.</p>

			<h2>WHY</h2>
			<p>In addition to athletics, Level Ground provides college access and career opportunities to Boston youth. Our young
			people are exposed to a disproportionately high level of poverty and crime, and live in neighborhoods that experience a
			greater prevalence of obesity-related illnesses. From assistance with college applications to employment at our gym,
			access to our weekly nutrition workshops, and free athletic training, Level Ground strives to meet the needs of our
			youth in an authentic and compassionate manner.</p>
